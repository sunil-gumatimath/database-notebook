## Database Compatibility

This repository is primarily designed for **MySQL/MariaDB**. While many scripts are standard SQL and may work on other RDBMS like PostgreSQL or Oracle, specific syntax or features might require adjustments. Notes for Oracle and PostgreSQL differences are included within individual SQL files where applicable.

| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------ | :--------------------------- |
| **`EMP`**      | `empno`, `ename`, `job`, `mgr`, `hiredate`, `sal`, `comm`, `deptno` | 14      | Employee details             |
| **`DEPT`**     | `deptno`, `dname`, `loc`                         | 4       | Department information       |

## How to Use

### Getting Started (MySQL/MariaDB)

This repository is primarily designed for MySQL/MariaDB. To get started, you can set up a local database and load one of the provided schemas.

1. **Create a database:**

   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE sql_practice;"
   ```

2. **Load a schema:**
   - For basic practice:

     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p sql_practice < 02-ddl/schemas/scott-schema.sql
     ```

   - For advanced practice (requires HR schema setup):

     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p sql_practice < 02-ddl/schemas/hr-schema.sql
     ```

3. **Connect and practice:**

   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p sql_practice
   ```

   Once connected, you can start querying, for example:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT * FROM emp;
   ```

**Note:** For other database systems like PostgreSQL or Oracle, please refer to the specific documentation or adapt the schema loading commands accordingly.

### Suggested Learning Path

**Beginner (4-6 weeks):**

1. Basics → Data types and constraints
2. DDL → Schema creation
3. DQL → Basic SELECT queries
4. Operators → Filtering patterns
5. DML → Data manipulation
6. Single-row functions → String, number, date functions
7. Aggregate functions → GROUP BY, HAVING
8. Complete assignments

**Intermediate (2-3 weeks):**

1. Advanced operators and filtering patterns
2. Subqueries basics (start with 08-subqueries/examples/subquery-basics.sql)
3. Joins → Combining table data (inner joins using HR schema)
4. Load HR schema for complex queries
5. Multi-level subqueries (4 assignment files available)
6. Complete all assignments including GPT-generated practice

**Advanced (future):**

1. Outer joins, full joins, cross joins
2. Indexes, transactions
3. Window functions, stored procedures
4. Performance optimization
