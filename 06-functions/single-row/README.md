# Single-Row Functions: Row-Level Operations

This directory covers single-row functions, which operate on individual rows to return a single result for each row processed. These functions are essential for data transformation and manipulation at the row level.

## Contents

- **Examples:**
  - [`examples/character-functions.sql`](examples/character-functions.sql) — Functions for manipulating character strings (e.g., `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `SUBSTR`, `LENGTH`).
  - [`examples/number-functions.sql`](examples/number-functions.sql) — Functions for mathematical and numeric operations (e.g., `ROUND`, `TRUNC`, `MOD`).
  - [`examples/date-functions.sql`](examples/date-functions.sql) — Functions for working with dates and times (e.g., `CURRENT_DATE`, date extraction, formatting).
  - [`examples/general-functions.sql`](examples/general-functions.sql) — Miscellaneous utility functions, including conditional logic.
- **Assignments:**
  - [`assignments/single-row-practice.sql`](assignments/single-row-practice.sql) — Practice tasks to apply single-row functions.
- **Notes:**
  - [`notes/quick-reference.sql`](notes/quick-reference.sql) — An overview and quick reference notes for single-row functions.

**Suggested Learning Order:** Begin with the `notes/quick-reference.sql` for a general understanding, then explore `examples/character-functions.sql`, `examples/number-functions.sql`, `examples/date-functions.sql`, and `examples/general-functions.sql` to learn about specific function types. Finally, practice your skills with the `assignments/single-row-practice.sql`.
