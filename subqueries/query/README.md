## Subquery Examples (Sequence)

This folder contains progressive subquery practice files.

Recommended order:
1. `subquery_01.sql` — Basic single-row subqueries
2. `subquery_02.sql` — Multi-row subqueries with `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`

Tip: Ensure sample tables from `ddl/scott_table.sql` or `ddl/hr_schema.sql` are loaded before running these.
