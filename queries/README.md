# Practice Queries: Hands-on Exercises

This directory contains a collection of small, self-contained SQL query exercises designed for hands-on practice. These queries reinforce concepts learned in other sections of the repository.

## Contents

- **Examples:**
  - [`examples/query_01.sql`](examples/query_01.sql) — Basic `SELECT` statements, filtering, and projections.
  - [`examples/query_02.sql`](examples/query_02.sql) — Additional practice queries covering various fundamental SQL concepts.
- **Assignments:**
  - [`assignments/assignment_01.sql`](assignments/assignment_01.sql) — A practice set focusing on filters, computed columns, and basic aggregations.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Query Writing:** Constructing `SELECT` statements with various clauses.
- **Data Filtering:** Using `WHERE` with different conditions.
- **Computed Columns:** Creating calculated fields in queries.
- **Basic Aggregations:** Simple use of aggregate functions.

**Prerequisite:** To effectively work with these queries, ensure you have loaded sample tables from either `../02-ddl/schemas/scott-schema.sql` or `../02-ddl/schemas/hr-schema.sql` into your database.
