# Practice Queries: Hands-on Exercises

This directory contains a collection of small, self-contained SQL query exercises designed for hands-on practice. These queries reinforce concepts learned in other sections of the repository.

## Contents

- **Examples:**
  - [`queries/examples/query_01.sql`](queries/examples/query_01.sql) — Basic `SELECT` statements, filtering, and projections.
  - [`queries/examples/query_02.sql`](queries/examples/query_02.sql) — Additional practice queries covering various fundamental SQL concepts.
- **Assignments:**
  - [`queries/assignments/assignment_01.sql`](queries/assignments/assignment_01.sql) — A practice set focusing on filters, computed columns, and basic aggregations.

**Prerequisite:** To effectively work with these queries, ensure you have loaded sample tables from either `ddl/scott_table.sql` or `ddl/hr_schema.sql` into your database.
