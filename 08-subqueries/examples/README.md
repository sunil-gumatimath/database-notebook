# Subquery Examples (Sequence)

This folder contains progressive subquery practice files.

Recommended order:

1. `subquery-basics.sql` — Core subquery concepts
2. `single-row-subqueries.sql` — Basic single-row subqueries
3. `multi-row-subqueries.sql` — Multi-row subqueries with `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`

Tip: Ensure sample tables from `../../02-ddl/schemas/scott-schema.sql` or `../../02-ddl/schemas/hr-schema.sql` are loaded before running these.
