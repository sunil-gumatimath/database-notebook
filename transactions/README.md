# Transactions: Ensuring Data Integrity

This directory is dedicated to understanding and demonstrating SQL transactions, which are crucial for maintaining data consistency and integrity. It covers the fundamental concepts of ACID properties, isolation levels, and error handling within database operations.

## Planned Content

- **Transaction Control:**
  - Demonstrations of `BEGIN TRANSACTION` (or equivalent), `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` commands.
- **Advanced Transaction Concepts:**
  - Usage of savepoints for nested transactions.
  - Explanation of different isolation levels (e.g., READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE).
  - Discussion of concurrency anomalies (e.g., dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads) and how isolation levels mitigate them.

## Current Status

This folder currently serves as a placeholder. SQL files (`.sql`) detailing transaction management concepts are yet to be added.
