# Views: Virtual Tables

This directory covers database views, which are virtual tables representing the result of a stored query. Views provide a way to simplify complex queries, restrict access to sensitive data, and present data in different ways without storing it physically.

## Planned Content

- **View Creation:** Syntax for creating simple and complex views using CREATE VIEW and CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW.
- **View Usage:** Querying views like regular tables, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations.
- **View Management:** Altering, dropping, and getting information about views.
- **Advanced Views:** Materialized views, indexed views, and partitioned views.
- **Best Practices:** When to use views, performance considerations, and security implications.

## Current Status

This folder currently serves as a placeholder. SQL files (`.sql`) detailing view concepts and examples are yet to be added. Note: Some view examples are currently located in [`indexes/indexes.sql`](indexes/indexes.sql), which may be relocated here in the future.
