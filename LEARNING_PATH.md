# Learning Path

A structured approach to mastering SQL concepts in this repository.

## Beginner Level (4-6 weeks)

### 1. Fundamentals

- Data types and constraints
- Basic SQL syntax and conventions

### 2. DDL (Data Definition Language)

- Schema creation and management
- Table operations: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE

### 3. DQL (Data Query Language)

- Basic SELECT queries
- Column selection and projections
- DISTINCT keyword

### 4. Operators

- Filtering patterns and logical operations
- Comparison operators
- Special operators: IN, LIKE, BETWEEN, IS NULL

### 5. DML (Data Manipulation Language)

- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- Data modification techniques

### 6. Single-Row Functions

- String manipulation functions
- Numeric functions
- Date and time functions
- Conditional logic

### 7. Aggregate Functions

- SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX
- GROUP BY clause
- HAVING clause for filtering groups
- ORDER BY for sorting results

## Intermediate Level (2-3 weeks)

### 8. Advanced Operators and Filtering

- Complex filtering patterns
- Regular expressions (REGEXP)

## Advanced Level (Future Topics)

### 11. Advanced Query Techniques

- Complex joins and multi-table queries
- Window functions
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

### 12. Database Objects

- Views: Virtual tables
- Indexes: Performance optimization
- Sequences: Auto-incrementing values

### 13. Transaction Management

- ACID properties
- Transaction control: COMMIT, ROLLBACK
- Isolation levels

### 14. Set Operators (Planned)

- UNION, UNION ALL
- INTERSECT
- MINUS/EXCEPT

### 15. Advanced Topics (Planned)

- Stored procedures
- Triggers
- User-defined functions

## Practice Recommendations

- Complete assignments in each section before moving forward
- Work with both SCOTT schema (simple) and HR schema (complex)
- Practice AI-generated exercises in the `10-practice/` directory
- Build your own queries combining multiple concepts
