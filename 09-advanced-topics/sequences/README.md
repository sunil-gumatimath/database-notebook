# Sequences: Auto-Incrementing Values

This directory is dedicated to understanding and demonstrating SQL sequences, which are database objects used to generate unique, sequential numbers automatically. Sequences are commonly used for generating primary key values.

## Planned Content

- **Sequence Creation:** Syntax and examples for creating sequences with various options (START WITH, INCREMENT BY, MAXVALUE, etc.).
- **Sequence Usage:** How to use sequences in INSERT statements and other contexts.
- **Sequence Management:** Altering, dropping, and querying sequence properties.
- **Practical Examples:** Real-world use cases and best practices.

## Current Status

This folder currently serves as a placeholder. SQL files (`.sql`) detailing sequence concepts and examples are yet to be added.
