## Joins

Purpose: Examples of combining rows from multiple tables using different JOIN types.

Suggested next steps:
- Add `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT/RIGHT OUTER JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`, and `SELF JOIN` examples.
- Include join conditions, aliasing, and filtering with `WHERE` vs `ON`.

Status: Folder placeholder created. Add `.sql` files when ready.
