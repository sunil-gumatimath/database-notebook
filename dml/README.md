# DML (Data Manipulation Language): Data Operations

This directory focuses on DML, the SQL commands used to modify the data within database tables.

## Contents:

- [`dml/dml_commands.sql`](dml/dml_commands.sql) â€” Demonstrates fundamental DML operations: `INSERT` (adding new rows), `UPDATE` (modifying existing rows), and `DELETE` (removing rows), with practical examples.

**Prerequisite:** Ensure that you have loaded sample tables from either `ddl/scott_table.sql` or `ddl/hr_schema.sql` into your database before executing the examples in this file.
