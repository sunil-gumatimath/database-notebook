# Indexes: Performance Optimization

This directory is intended to contain scripts and notes on SQL indexing strategies for performance optimization.

## Current Status

This folder contains content on database views rather than indexes. The [`indexes/indexes.sql`](indexes/indexes.sql) file includes examples of creating, querying, and dropping views. SQL files specifically detailing indexing concepts are yet to be added.

## Planned Topics

- Creating and dropping indexes (unique vs. non-unique).
- Understanding composite and covering indexes.
- Analyzing scenarios where indexes improve or degrade performance, including the use of `EXPLAIN` plans.
