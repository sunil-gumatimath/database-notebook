# Indexes: Performance Optimization

This directory is intended to contain scripts and notes on SQL indexing strategies for performance optimization.

## Current Status:

This folder currently serves as a placeholder. SQL files (`.sql`) detailing indexing concepts are yet to be added.

## Planned Topics:

- Creating and dropping indexes (unique vs. non-unique).
- Understanding composite and covering indexes.
- Analyzing scenarios where indexes improve or degrade performance, including the use of `EXPLAIN` plans.
