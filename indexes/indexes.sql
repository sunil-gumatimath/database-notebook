-- What is a View?
-- A View is a virtual table based on the result of a SQL query.
-- It does not store data physically; it just displays data from one or more tables.
-- Helps simplify complex queries and restrict access to sensitive data.

-- Why use Views?
-- Simplify complex queries for users
-- Hide certain columns or sensitive data
-- Reuse queries without rewriting them
