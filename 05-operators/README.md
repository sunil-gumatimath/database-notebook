# Operators: Filtering and Logical Operations

This directory covers SQL operators, which are used in `WHERE` clauses and other expressions to filter data, perform comparisons, and implement logical operations.

## Contents

- **Examples:**
  - [`examples/operators-demo.sql`](examples/operators-demo.sql) — Demonstrates various operators including comparison operators (`=`, `>`, `<`, etc.), logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), `IN`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IS NULL`, and boolean logic.
- **Assignments:**
  - [`assignments/operators-practice.sql`](assignments/operators-practice.sql) — Practice tasks designed to reinforce the understanding and application of SQL operators.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Comparison Operators:** `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `<>`, `!=`.
- **Logical Operators:** `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` for combining conditions.
- **Special Operators:** `IN`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IS NULL` for pattern matching and null checks.
